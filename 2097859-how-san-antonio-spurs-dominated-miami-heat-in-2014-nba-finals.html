The offense looked how a world-class orchestra sounds, with every instrument tuned to perfection.</p><p>Miami was helpless in trying to rotate to the open men that were inevitably found by San Antonio's crisp passing on every possession.</p><p>The Heat made a run in the second half to cut a 24-point lead down to seven, but the hole they were in was just too deep. San Antonio regained control and wound up winning 111-92.</p><p>The Spurs didn't shoot the ball as well in Game 4, but somehow seemed even more control, as they cruised to a 107-86 victory.</p><p>At that point, Wade really started to look like the pace of the game had passed him by. He couldn't keep up with Mills or Danny Green as a defender and he could barely score to save his life on the other end.
