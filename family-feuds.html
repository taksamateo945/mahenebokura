Specifically, two families in the four-corners area of the Texas counties of Fannin, Grayson, Collin, and Hunt refused to accept that the war had concluded — and kept fighting for four bloody years.</p><p>This fierce rivalry came to be known as the Lee-Peacock feud and saw the families of Bob Lee and Lewis Peacock engage in a series of battles from 1867 to 1871.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Legends of America</a>, when the Civil War broke out, Bob Lee was quick to enlist with the Confederate Army, despite being married with three children. He wound up serving with the Ninth Texas Cavalry along with some other young men in the area: John, William, Francis, and Jim Maddox, and several of the Boren boys.</p><p>But near the end of the war, Lee received news that troubled him. An organization called the Union League had cropped up, and they were working to protect Black Americans and Union sympathizers. Even more troubling for Lee was that this league was being run by a man named Lewis Peacock at Pilot Grove, just seven miles from his own home.</p><p>Of course, Union sympathizers weren’t treated with kind regard in the Confederate states, and so by the time Lee and the others returned home, tensions were already high. Many people had begun to look to Bob Lee as a natural leader for the “Civil War” that was still being fought in Texas after the introduction of Reconstruction ideals.</p><p>Naturally, Peacock came to view Lee as a problem as well. Should Lee rally people behind him, it could prove to be a detriment to the Union League or even Reconstruction as a whole.</p><p>Peacock began targeting Lee, first by “arresting” him for crimes he had allegedly committed during the war. Peacock’s group then took Lee’s watch and a $20 gold coin and forced him to sign a promissory note for $2,000. The Lees refused to pay, though, and the court ruled that they didn’t have to.</p><p>Things escalated quickly from there, and soon enough, it was essentially an all-out war between Peacock’s and Lee’s sympathizers. Within just one year, the conflict had become so fierce that Peacock requested help from the federal government, and a $1,000 reward was put in place for Bob Lee’s capture.</p><p>Lee was ultimately shot down by U.S. Cavalry on May 24, 1869, but that didn’t put an end to the fighting. It was Lewis Peacock’s death on June 13, 1871, that finally ended the feud. In total, it is estimated that around 50 people died as a result of the rivalry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynrcyio7JllprCpb%2BOcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./todd-deforest-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Todd Deforest Obituary: Remembering Todd DeForest,Poquoson, VA, Former PHS Football Coach, Todd Defo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-barnett.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Barnett- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
