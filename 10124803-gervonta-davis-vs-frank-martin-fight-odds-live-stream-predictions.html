He'll get another notable opponent here as the unbeaten Martin is ranked fifth among lightweights by <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN</a>.</p><p>Witha world title on the line and one of boxing biggest stars making a return after more than a year away, this is one of the highlights of the summer boxing schedule.</p><p>Here's a look at all the info you need to catch the card which has David Benavidez in the co-main slot from Vegas.</p><p><b>When: </b>Saturday, June 14 at 8 p.m. ET (main event ringwalks approximately 11 p.m. ET)</p><p><b>Where: </b>MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas</p><p><b>Odds: </b>Davis -700 ($700 wager wins $100); Martin +475 ($100 wager wins $450)</p><p>Davis is still a massive favorite despite the longest layoff of his career. However, Martin hasn't fought in over a year as well so the potential for ring rust is a thing both fighters will have to overcome.</p><p>Davis' layoff was partially caused by a <a href=# rel=noopener>44-day stint</a> in a Baltimore detention center. Davis was found to have violated his house arrest and had to serve the rest of his sentence at the facility. He believes the time has helped him as a man and will be reflected in his performance in the ring.</p><p>"I think I'm much more smarter than I was when I fought Ryan, only because of the things I went through in life," Davis told <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Coppinger</a> of ESPN. "I feel as though it matured me, as a man, as a person. And I think it will help in boxing. ... I think I'll be much better than I was before."</p><p>The bout with Martin provides Davis to get back to doing what he does best and recapture some momentum that's lost in a long layoff. At 29 years old, Davis is squarely in his prime and has the opportunity to create some massive paydays if he can get another convincing win.</p><p>Martin is a worthy opponent. He's taller and will have a reach advantage that Davis will have to navigate to land his patented, powerful hook.</p><p><b>Prediction</b></p><p>Despite Martin's ranking and sterling record, this still feels like a bit of a tuneup fight for Davis. He's also undefeated but has captured world titles in the process. His win against Ryan Garcia has aged well after Garcia beat Devin Haney.</p><p>Martin might be able to use his jab to win a few early rounds, but that's not a new challenge for Davis. He's shown a penchant for utilizing his power and counter-punching to make opponent's pay for even the smallest lack of focus.</p><p>Ultimatley, Davis is on another level than Martin and he should be able to find another finish after doing some early work to the body.</p><p><b>Davis via eighth-round TKO</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmFcX%2BMoJyrrp%2BjwaJ5w5qtoqtdq8BustGapaRlnZa%2FtbXNZp2in5iperCww6xkpaGmmnq0wNGemKZloKeypbXCraCopqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-blakely-may-dennis-christina-mandrell-daughter-relationship-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Blakely May Dennis, Christina Mandrell Daughter: Relationship &amp;amp; Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brooke-shields-shares-sweet-kiss-with-husband-chris-henchy-in-nyc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brooke Shields shares sweet kiss with husband Chris Henchy in NYC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
