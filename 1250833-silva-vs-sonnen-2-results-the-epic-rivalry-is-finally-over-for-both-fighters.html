Rebilas-US PRESSWIRE)</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit></span><p>The <a href=#>Anderson Silva</a> vs. Chael Sonnen rematch was one of the most anticipated fights in UFC history, and Silva was able to deliver with a brutal TKO victory against his American foe.</p><p>The rivalry is now finished—so finished that Silva actually invited Sonnen to a BBQ at his house following the fight.&nbsp; During the post-fight press conference, Sonnen said he’s starving and would love a Brazilian BBQ, but only if whatever is cooked is medium rare.</p><p>A potential trilogy fight clearly wouldn't make sense unless Sonnen won the championship, but since he was finished in dominating fashion, there definitely isn’t a reason for a third fight now.&nbsp; It’s time for Silva and Sonnen to both move on after a two-year emotional roller coaster for both fighters.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first round, Sonnen quickly secured a takedown against Silva.&nbsp; He didn’t land any significant ground-and-pound damage on Silva, despite ending the round in full mount.&nbsp; It initially looked like the fight would follow the same path as their first encounter, with Silva trying to defend off his back again.</p><p>Fortunately for the champion, Sonnen made a mistake trying to get a bit too cute with a spinning backfist—that he missed horribly—before being battered on the ground. &nbsp;After watching Silva land a beautiful knee to the body of his downed opponent, and then utilize heavy ground-and-pound, it’d be difficult to try and say Sonnen warrants a rematch at any point in the future.</p><p>Following the fight, it seems that both fighters understand that their long-disputed battle has finally come to a close.&nbsp; The UFC now will try and figure out who is next to challenge Silva and what is next for Sonnen.</p><p>This is what Silva had to say following the victory (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via UFC.com</a>): “Let’s show Brazil has manners.&nbsp; I want everyone to applaud for Chael.&nbsp; If you’d like to have a barbecue over (at) my house, I’d love to have you."</p><p>For his part, Sonnen acknowledged that Silva was able to get the better of him in their rematch, saying, “They gave me the opportunity.&nbsp; Nobody owes me anything.&nbsp; He’s a true champion, man.&nbsp; He got me with a good shot.”</p><p>As for what’s next for Silva, former light heavyweight Rashad Evans looks like he wants a chance to try and dethrone the Brazilian Muay Thai fighter.&nbsp; However, the middleweight division will need to sort itself out now, with Michael Bisping, Alan Belcher, Brian Stann and Hector Lombard all hoping to earn a title shot.</p><p>Please feel free to follow me on Twitter.&nbsp;
