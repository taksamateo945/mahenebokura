Jesseca was in her element, and she loved creating new and unique styles and exploring colour.</p><p class=align-left>After a while, Judy became the co-owner of a salon. She was focused on her work and took clients on Sundays, Mondays and holidays when most stylists would never. This allowed her to charge a premium price and stack her coins. During this time, she took an interest in social media and developed her online persona, Judy.

She revealed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beauty Independent </a>that she had miscarried twins between 17 and 19.</p>It was difficult because of the workload it required. I transferred from that school to the cosmetology school. When I got pregnant with the twins before I miscarried, my mom put me out because she felt like she couldn't keep supporting me. Ultimately, getting put out made me the strong independent person that I am today, so I'm thankful she did that.<p class=align-left>Jesseca Dupart's son is Byron Jr. Her other two children are Jay and Deja.</p><h3>Is Jesseca Dupart a millionaire?</h3><p class=align-left>Judy has made a fortune from her career as an entrepreneur.
