Finally...The Rock has become the WWE champion again.</p><p>It wasn't the smoothest match, but the ending was entertaining.</p><p><span><strong>Momentum Shifts</strong></span></p><p><strong>Attacking the People's Stomach</strong></p><p>As you might expect, there were several momentum shifts. CM Punk took aim on The Rock's injured ribs as he dropped the People's Champ on top of the collapsable barricade.&nbsp;</p><p>This assault on the midsection went on for most of the beginning of the match.</p><p><strong>Punk's Knee Buckles</strong></p><p>Punk tried a high-risk maneuver, but he seemingly tweaked the knee he injured a few months ago. The Rock took advantage for a short period of time but not to the extent that Punk attacked the Brahma Bull's stomach.</p><p>It turned out to be a non-factor in the match.</p><p><strong>The Table Botch</strong></p><p>After the action spilled to the outside of the ring, The Rock was set to Rock Bottom the champion through the Spanish announce table, but the table gave out.</p><p>The Rock might have really injured his knee on this one.</p><p>They improvised and allowed The Rock to hit his finisher on the floor, but it was one of the most memorable screw-ups in recent WWE pay-per-view history.</p><p><strong>The Shield Ruins Everything?</strong></p><p>The lights go out and, of course, The Rock gets put through the announcer's table. The Shield attacked and CM Punk pins the Great One, but Mr. McMahon wasn't having it.</p><p>He came out and ordered the match to continue.</p><p>The Shield should have been used in a better way for this show. Their blacked-out appearance seemed like a waste.</p><p>The Rock took advantage of the second chance, and he ended Punk's long title run with an electrifying People's Elbow.</p><p><span><strong>Grading the Participants</strong></span></p><p><strong>The Rock: B</strong></p><p>Considering he's been out of action for a month, he did a decent job, but he wasn't quite as sharp as he was against John Cena at WrestleMania.</p><p><strong>CM Punk: B-</strong></p><p>The defending champion was not his normal dynamic self. Perhaps he had to slow the pace for The Rock, as their conversations were too apparent throughout the match, but he didn't ruin things by any stretch.</p><p><strong>The Shield: F</strong></p><p>It's obviously not their fault, but a 15-second appearance in a blacked out arena was just crazy. These guys have built a very strong following, and they should have been showcased more.</p><p><strong>Overall Match Grade: B</strong></p><p>Had Mr. McMahon not come out to restart the match, I would have called it a C based on predictability and mediocre action, but the twist at the end bumped it up for me.</p><p>Follow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Mazique</a> and Franchiseplay on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> for reactions, analysis and news from the world of sports and sports video games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5oZGd%2BcnnToZxmqp%2BYuG7C0maapmWgqrusedGeqq6kpKh6uLXNp5yrZZietKm4yKCfratdlruledGempqoXZu%2FsLmMq6aymZxiv7a5waWcZqigqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bridget-satterlee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bridget Satterlee Celebsgraphy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./satyrs-say-nyt-crossword-clue-find-puzzle-answer-here-1239238.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Satyrs, say NYT Crossword Clue Find Puzzle Answer Here</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
