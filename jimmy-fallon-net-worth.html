He was born on September 19, 1974 in Brooklyn, New York. His mother is Gloria and his father is James. His family is very Irish and German, and he stands 6-feet tall, which is always a little bit of a surprise to those who meet him as he seems much shorter. Jimmy Fallon grew up in New York while his father worked as a repairman for IBM. He was a war veteran before. He enjoyed his childhood very much, calling his parents excellent and stating that it was a pretty good childhood in all accounts. He has an older sister, but their parents were a bit overprotective not allowing the kids to leave the house; but it did work for him.</p><p>Growing up, <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon always knew he was funny</a>. He went to school and he wanted to be a priest after he became an altar boy, but he later changed his mind when he realized just how hilarious he actually is, and then he made the decision to go into comedy. He works hard as a young man to achieve his dreams and make that happen, but it did not happen overnight. His parents taped Saturday Night Live for him and allowed him to watch any parts that they deemed appropriate, and he became obsessed with the show. He began making impersonations, something he is quite famous for, when he was a teenager; even his parents were highly impressed and learned to recognize that their son was a very talented young man.</p><p>When Jimmy Fallon dropped out of college to pursue his comedy career, his family was not thrilled. They backed his decision, and he made good on his promise to be successful. He had a number of jobs working in stand-up that paid the bills, but his big break finally came in SNL. At the time, he was only 23 and he impressed writer Tina Fey so much that she stated to the press that Jimmy Fallon and Kristen Wiig were the only two people she’d ever seen audition for the show who were completely ready for their roles.</p><p>It was 1998 when he made his first official appearance, and his career went crazy from there. He was soon being cast in movies, in television shows, making guest appearances and becoming one of the most famous faces on SNL. At the moment, he is the host of the Tonight Show. He made his debut in 2014 and though people were not sure he’d make it following in Jay Leno’s footsteps, he’s made his way and has a huge following. He’s married to Nancy Juvonen, since 2007. Together, they have two daughters both born via surrogacy. So far, he is one of the most successful comics in the world, and his career is long running at this point but nowhere near over. He will continue to gain more success and make more money.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGihoqWdrnqnrculpqdlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacob-batalon-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Spider-Man: Homecoming Star; Who is Jacob Batalon?EXPLORE His Wiki Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./capital-of-iowa-2-wds-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Capital of Iowa: 2 wds.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
