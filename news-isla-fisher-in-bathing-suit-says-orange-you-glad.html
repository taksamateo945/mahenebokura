On Thursday, the 46-year-old Wolf Like Me star flaunted her phenomenal figure in an orange swimsuit on social media, also wearing her trademark mischievous grin. "Orange you glad to see me," she cheekily captioned the image of herself. How does the <span>Australian </span>wife of <span>Sacha</span> Baron Cohen—who you loved in Wedding Crashers and Arrested Development—keep herself so fit? Read on to see 7 ways Isla Fisher stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Isla tries to set herself up for exercise success. "I'm definitely not a morning person. I struggle to be happy before 11am, even though my alarm goes off at 7am," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Sun</span></a><span>. "I'll take a quick shower and usually dress in workout wear in an attempt to inspire myself to exercise at some point during the day, which rarely happens."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-927284606.jpg><p><span>Isla's diet is healthy but reasonable. "Breakfast is a flurry of making porridge and Rice Krispies. Before I head out the door, I'll make myself a latte with our fancy coffee machine," she says, admitting to eating pastries to "cure" her writer's block. "When I'm working on a book I need frequent breaks to keep my spirits up, and I'll tuck into a pastry whenever I run out of inspiration. It means I can barely fit into my jeans by the time I've completed the book!" she jokes. For dinner, "Sacha makes an amazing tomato sauce," she said. "He crams it full of secret veggies and it's honestly better than any marinara I've ever tasted – even from Italy! If I'm cooking dinner then I like to make chicken soup, grilled fish or something child-friendly like schnitzel. If I was on death row my last meal would definitely be Thai green chicken curry."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1173051382.jpg><p><span>"I eat like a seagull," she added to The Sun. "Usually I'll grab whatever the other people in my house don't want, which is anything from spare carrots to nuts and leftover pasta." She is also a snacker. "I have a giant bag of cashew nuts at all times in case I need a quick snack, too. I never bother cooking just for myself – I'll send for takeout or have a meeting at a restaurant for lunch."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1314454209.jpg><p><span>Isla revealed to Fitness, per PopSugar, that she isn't a big fan of the gym. Instead she prefers daily swims with her children or a hike near her home. "<span>You may not be able to hike the Appalachian Trail or climb Mount Everest this summer, but you still can take a walk on the wild side by seeking out trails and parks closer to home. When you're on the move outdoors, those benefits can be good for both your physical and mental health," reports <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>.</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1134797059.jpg><p><span>She also revealed to fitness that she loves yoga for the "mind-body experience" and practices it five days a week. After a busy day, "I go back to my yoga practice and I breathe," she says. "<span>When you're first getting started with your home yoga practice, there's nothing wrong with following along with an app or a video. But know that you have the option to create a more personal practice once you feel comfortable enough to do so. You don't have to do a 30- or 60-minute flow-based session every time. You can do a couple of yoga poses and meditate, you can stretch do and breath work or you can meditate the entire time," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Cleveland Clinic</a>.<br></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoquclnqntdKhnKtlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyYsqtdpL%2BiusaeZLKnpWK0ra3DaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nyt-crossword-answers-for-october-19-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NYT Crossword Answers for October 19 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-mayer-has-this-to-say-about-ex-girlfriend-taylor-swift-right-now-2015103.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John Mayer Has This to Say About Ex-Girlfriend Taylor Swift Right Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
