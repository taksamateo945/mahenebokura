His brother, who also happened to be a dancer, Travis Wall, confirmed that the 35-year-old reality TV competitor passed away.</p><p>Page Six reported on an Instagram post from his brother from Saturday morning, in which he mourned the loss of his brother, whom he described as a gift. Wall said he wasn’t ready to see him go. Wall’s post was especially tragic. He added near the end, “I can’t believe this is real, I can’t believe you’re gone.”</p><p>You can check out his post below:</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9cPhB_J_kK/</p><p>According to Page Six, Tidwell was a contestant during the third season of So You Think You Can Dance back in 2007. He was the runner-up. Hailing from Norfolk, Virginia, the star was 22-years-old at the time of the competition and danced contemporary.</p><p>USA Today reported that Tidwell started dancing at a young age during an after-school program in Virginia. His teacher of the time, Denise Wall, noticed that Tidwell wasn’t registered at the school and he was often without any supervision for a good portion of the day.</p><p>Wall said to The Virginia-Pilot back in 2007 that she eventually obtained legal guardianship over him, and he came to live with her and her sons at their home. Denise soon took him into their home after obtaining legal guardianship, and he became a member of the family, even referring to her other children as his brothers.</p><p>Travis Wall also competed on the same show but in the previous season. He finished second. In a tribute to the 35-year-old on Twitter, Debbie Allen, who was a judge during Tidwell’s season, referred to him as a “dancing genius.”</p><p>Other executives and starring personalities in the TV series, including the co-creator and judge, Nigel Lythgoe, also shared his condolences on the social media platform, as did Comfort Fedoke, a contestant from the fourth season.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Comfort shared one of Tidwell’s performances on IG.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUlruvxYytoJ2vlaG5brLRqKRmq59ixrDBjK2foqabYsawwYycmKdllJa7pLGMqZisq5WoeqLDwLJkoqZdmK6zecCcmqKclaPBbq3TZmpuZWNsg3Z9lWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keefe-d-could-be-soon-arrested-for-tupac-shakurs-murder.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keefe D Could Be Soon Arrested For Tupac Shakur's Murder!!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./usyk-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Usyk Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
