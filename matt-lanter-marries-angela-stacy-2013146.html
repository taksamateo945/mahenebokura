The former 90210 actor tied the knot with fellow Ohio native <strong>Angela</strong> <strong>Stacy</strong> at the Calamigos Ranch in Malibu on Friday, June 14, <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> can exclusively confirm.&nbsp;</p><p>A source tells Us that the couple got married “in a&nbsp;cottage pavilion under an archway of white hydrangeas and strands of crystals hanging from the trees.”</p><p>Lanter and his groomsen, including&nbsp;<strong>Justin Gaston,&nbsp;</strong>(who dated<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>&nbsp;in 2009) and E! News correspondent,&nbsp;<strong>Jason Kennedy,</strong> wore gray suits for the evening. The source reveals that Gaston even performed for the couple — playing his guitar and singing during the 20 minute ceremony. &nbsp;</p><p>“Their vows were personal,” the source tells Us. “Matt talked about how Angela is his whole life.”</p><p>The blushing bride wore a strapless gown that flared out mermaid style with scalloped tulle at the bottom, the source continues, noting that “she was incredibly tan and her hair was swept back in a low pony.”</p><p>On Friday, June 14, Stacy already changed her Twitter profile picture, showing off her gorgeous wedding day look.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Stacy’s bridesmaids, wearing silver dresses, flanked the bride during her big day. After the touching ceremony, guests enjoyed the cocktail hour, where tunes from <strong>Backstreet Boys</strong>,<strong> Bruno Mars</strong> and <strong>Maroon 5 </strong>were played, before heading to the reception, with a “red carpet entrance” waiting for them.&nbsp;</p><p>“Inside the tent, there are tables with white hydrangea floral arrangements and hurricane candles,” an insider tells Us. “There’s a separate section with a lounge set up with white leather couches and ottomans.”</p><p>A source tells Us that Lanter, a big Star Wars fan, was greeted by people dressed up as Storm Troopers, who joined the couple at the reception, taking photos with the entire wedding party and walking in behind the newlyweds as they were announced to their guests.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once the wedding party was introduced, the Star Wars theme music came on,” the source tells Us. “The emcee introduced Matt and Angela, ‘From a galaxy far away, I would like to introduce for the first time, Mr. and Mrs. Lanter!!'”</p><p>After the unique introduction and the couple’s first dance, everyone settled into their tables to eat as a live <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>-sounding band played classic tunes, adds the source.&nbsp;</p><p>According to an insider, the newlyweds will leave for their honeymoon on June 16. At the CW Upfront event in New York City May 16, Lanter admitted there was still plenty to do before their big day arrived.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re right in the midst of the crazy wedding planning chaos,” he told <strong>Us</strong>. “A lot of details are still being worked out and I feel like it’s crunch time.” Lanter had previously said the ceremony would “be outdoorsy. I’m a huge fan of nature and she is, too.”</p><p>The newlyweds will soon be relocating to New Orleans, where Lanter is shooting his new CW series Star-Crossed (opposite <strong>Aimee Teegarden</strong>). “We’re in the midst of a move,” the L.A.-based actor told <strong>Us</strong> in May. “Picking up everything and going somewhere else — and getting married! — it’s a cool, fun new chapter in my life.”</p><p>The couple got&nbsp;<a href=#>engaged</a>&nbsp;during a romantic trip to Paris in May 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSarKRiuaK6056pZqWRp7%2BqsdJmmKeflaGubr%2FTmpqyZWJlfnR9k28%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./queen-elizabeth-reportedly-shot-down-meghan-markle-and-prince-harrys-dreams-of-living-at-windsor-castle-313805.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Queen Elizabeth Reportedly Shot Down Meghan Markle And Prince Harrys Dreams Of Living At Windsor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10125420-report-ncaa-unveils-mens-march-madness-expansion-plans-with-additional-4-8-teams.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Report: NCAA Unveils Men's March Madness Expansion Plans with Additional 4-8 Teams | News, Scores, H</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
