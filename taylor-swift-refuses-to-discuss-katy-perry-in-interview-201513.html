"I’m not walking up the street with boys, I’m not stumbling out of clubs drunk," she continued. "But I’m never going to talk about her in my interview. It’s not going to happen."</p><p>The pop stars' public spat started last fall when Swift <a href=#>revealed to Rolling Stone</a> that one of her singles from 1989, "Bad Blood," was written for an unnamed mean girl. In the piece, Swift described the anonymous fellow pop star as her "straight-up enemy."</p><p>Meanwhile, the very same day the story went live, Perry, 30, tweeted: "Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing," fueling speculation that the song was indeed about her. Us Weekly then confirmed that "Bad Blood" was, in fact, written for Perry.</p><p>An insider told<strong> Us </strong>at the time that the two superstars — both of whom have dated <strong><a href=#>John Mayer</a></strong>&nbsp;(Perry is on-again with the Paradise Valley crooner) — were "very competitive."</p><p>Ahead of her Super Bowl halftime gig last month, Perry <a href=#>addressed her ongoing feud</a> with Swift, telling Billboard: "If somebody is trying to defame my character, you're going to hear about it."</p><p>Several weeks later, <strong>Us </strong>reported that the <a href=#>two had a near run-in</a> during the 2015 Grammys.</p><p>In the interim, Swift has been focused on creating "a beautiful life," as she explained to The Telegraph in her most recent interview. While still uncertain about her life at age 30, Swift reflected: "I’ll probably still be single, let’s be honest. No one’s going to sign up for this and everything that goes with it. Like, “Hi, nice to meet you, want a date? Do you love camera flashes? I hope you do!'"</p><p>The superstar, who's famously dated stars like <strong><a href=#>Joe Jonas</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Harry Styles</a></strong>, told the paper that she doesn't even know if it's possible. "I don’t know what’s going to happen if I’m ever content in a relationship — no idea how that’s going to work," she said with smile. "I don’t even know if that’s possible with the life I have."</p><p>She then joked: ‘“In five years’ time she’ll be so afraid of everything, she doesn’t leave her house,'" mocking herself: ‘“She’s just surrounded by cats. So many cats, they’ve divided themselves up into armies and she wanders around lint-rolling the couch that no one’s going to sit on because she’s afraid to have people over…”’</p><p>Along with her speculative romantic future, Swift also boldly proclaimed that her next album — after the smash success of 1989 — will be even better. "I’m not going to put out an album until I’ve made one that’s better than this one," she mused. "And that’s going to be really hard."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The songstress also spoke about how future love might affect her music. "If that does happen, I think I could find complexity in happiness," she told the paper. "I don’t think anything’s ever simple. Just because you’re happy in a relationship doesn’t mean that there aren’t moments of confusion or frustration or loneliness or sadness. Hopefully, if I ever find some sort of meaningful relationship, I’ll be able to still find inspiration, just through the everyday ups and downs."</p><p>For now, the songstress has been growing with the help of her amazing group of girlfriends including lifelong BFF <strong>Abigail Anderson</strong>, supermodel<strong> Karlie Kloss, Lorde</strong>, the <strong>Haim sisters</strong>, and more.</p><p>"The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship," she told the paper. "I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are. A lot of celebrity-type people have this group of people around them where their friends’ main priority is them, and they feel comfortable with that dynamic. I don’t feel comfortable with that dynamic."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWimrO2v8SsZK2nXZm2tK%2FUrKpmo5Gpxm68xKupsmWZo3qqutOeqa%2Bhlax6c3yQbmhs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./175214-tyla-excited-t-wait-perform-hey-neighbour-festival.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyla Excited and Cant Wait To Perform In South Africa at the Hey Neighbour Festival</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kathryn-dennis-says-she-still-drinks-alcohol-her-substance-abuse-issues-are-with-marijuana-not-booze-313843.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kathryn Dennis Says She Still Drinks Alcohol Her Substance Abuse Issues Are With Marijuana, Not</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
