The Playboy magazine’s July 1977 issue Playmate of the Month had her two children with her ex-husband and Playboy manager, Ray Manzella.</p><p>The 67-year-old’s status as one of the biggest sex symbols of the 1970s was cemented by the July 1977 accolade she received from Playboy magazine, and given that she was just over 20 years old at the time, her time on that elevated platform appeared long-lasting.</p><p>However, just about eight years later, she shocked the inhabitants of the infamous Playboy Mansion, where she was a resident at the time, to get married and have children. Years later, the two children the model had with her ex-husband are her source of pride and joy, a fact that Sondra has reiterated on several occasions. Armed with the knowledge of the pride she derives from being called the mother of Taylor and Katie Manzella, we invite our readers to meet Sondra Theodore’s now-adult children.</p><h2><strong>Sondra Theodore Had Her Children With Playboy Manager Ray Manzella</strong></h2><p>When Sondra Theodore left the Playboy mansion, she pitched her tent with Ray Manzella, a friend of the late Playboy Magazine founder, Hugh Hefner. At the time, Manzella was also managing other Playboy stars as well such as Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy.</p><p>The former married couple dated briefly before exchanging marital vows in 1985. Their wedding, including the ceremony itself, and the reception, was hosted at the Playboy Mansion, and the former couple also received a $25k wedding gift from the man affectionately called Hef.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/BeFunky-collage-72.jpg><p>When the dust of the festivities settled, Sondra settled down to married life with Manzella. Her new life was a far cry from what she experienced as a Playmate, but she didn’t mind at all. In the beginning, it was just Theodore and her now ex-husband, but the kids came soon after.</p><p>Although their marriage lasted for just over a decade, Theodore had her first child with Ray Manzella just about a couple of years after their wedding. The child, in this case, a son named <strong>Taylor Manzella</strong>, arrived in 1987. Just about a year later in 1988, Taylor became a big brother to a little sister who was named <strong>Katie Manzella</strong> by Sondra and her then-husband.</p><p>Both of Sondra Theodore’s children were born over 30 years ago, and have since become responsible adults. Here is what we know about them, their relationship with the actress and her ex-husband, how they earn a living, and certain known aspects of their personal life.</p><h2><strong>Sondra Theodore’s Oldest Child, Taylor Manzella, Is Over 36 Years Old Now</strong></h2><p>For most surviving members of the older generation, it only feels like yesterday when Sondra Theodore welcomed her first child and only son Taylor John Manzella into the world. In reality, though, it’s been over three decades since the celebrity son was born in the Pacific Palisades, California, on February 27, 1987. He is currently 36 years old and even has a family of his own.</p><p>Before we get into that aspect of his personal life, it’s important to address other aspects of his identity including the fact that he is an American citizen and was born under the zodiac sign of Pisces.</p><h3><strong>Taylor Manzella’s Father Is A Manager and A Film Producer</strong></h3><p>Born Raymond Manzella in San Fernando Valley, California, United States, on February 24, 1948, Taylor’s dad is a renowned Hollywood manager and film producer. While not much is known about members of his birth family including his parents and siblings, the talent manager has worked with several Hollywood stars such as Kim Alexis, Suzanne Somers, Jenny McCarthy, Pamela Anderson, and Vanna White, amongst others.</p><p>Taylor’s father’s professional career identity remains solidified as a Hollywood big shot but few people are aware of the fact that his career began as a salesperson in finance. After working his way into the Playboy mansion, he struck up a friendship with the late Hugh Hefner, and that paved the way for him to begin working with stars such as the aforementioned caliber.</p><p>He eventually started his own management company Manzella Entertainment LLC in January 1985, the same year, he met and eventually married Taylor’s mother. Taylor’s parents got married on November 2, 1985, a year after his father had ended his marriage to his second wife, Robin Mattson, whom he had married on May 27, 1978.</p><p>Before Mattson, Ray Manzella was married to Bonnie Lutz for about eight years from September 3, 1966, to 1974. Given that his father’s first marriage had also lasted less than a decade, Taylor Manzella’s father’s marriage to his mother Sondra Theodore remains the movie producer’s longest marriage to date, during which time they had Taylor and his younger sister, Katie.</p><h3><strong>Taylor Manzella Has A Good Relationship With His Mother</strong></h3><p>Ray Manzella was not much of a father to his son, Taylor, during the 11 years he was married to Sondra in large part due to his career commitments. However, in the years that followed the dissolution of his marriage to Sondra Theodore, we have yet to uncover the full extent of his contributions to the upbringing and well-being of Taylor, and his younger sister, Katie.</p><p>On the other hand, Taylor’s mom was everything a child could ask of and more. Recall that she ultimately left the Playboy mansion to be a wife and a mother, and while her commitment to her wifely responsibilities was scuppered by her ex-husband’s philandering ways and eventual divorce, she was determined to make the most of her motherly responsibilities.</p><p>The caring and loving relationship, seen and unseen, between mother and son indicate that she has done a good job.</p><h3><strong>Taylor Manzella Is A Real Estate Agent In California</strong></h3><p>Details of the early years of Taylor Monzella’s formal educational background are unknown at present but several reliable sources confirm that he is a graduate of Business Administration after attending the University of Phoenix. Currently, he allegedly works as a real estate agent in California but not much is known about his work in that regard.</p><h3><strong>Sondra Theodore’s First Son Is Married</strong></h3><p>During the 2020 Pandemic year, Taylor Manzella tied the proverbial knot with his long-time girlfriend, Mary. Not much is known about how or when they met or even when they got married but we can confirm from his mother’s Instagram page that the wedding took place during the Pandemic year.</p><p>While expressing her joy over her son’s nuptials, Sondra also took the time to extoll the many qualities he has exhibited in the past, as well as telling both him and his wife to be good to each other, a gesture that was greatly applauded by virtually everyone who saw the post.</p><p>But for the fact that he is related to celebrity parents in the form of Ray Manzella and Sondra Theodore, Taylor Manzella would probably be just one of many real estate agents living in California. His celebrity status, notwithstanding, the 36-year-old real estate agent has managed to keep other relevant aspects of his life well hidden.</p><p>Beyond her first name, there is not enough information on the identity of the woman he married. So far too, we have no way of knowing if the marriage has been blessed with children. Our best guess on the matter though is that they are not yet parents as given how close to her children she is, Sondra would have let the world know as soon as any kid was born.</p><h2><strong>Katie Manzella Is Sondra Theodore’s Youngest Child</strong></h2><p>Katie Manzella was born Katie Jo Manzella on October 26, 1988, in Pacific Palisades, California. The time of her birth came almost two years after the birth of her older brother Taylor with whom she shares a very close relationship.</p><p>Katie spent the first eight years of her existence on earth in a household that included two parents, and ultimately a family of four including her beloved older brother. Just like her brother is the only son of her mother, Katie is her mother’s only daughter.</p><p>She did not, however, get to experience the relative bliss of growing up in a family that includes two parents as her parents split up in 1996 a few years before she entered high school.</p><h3><strong>Katie Manzella Enjoys A Good Relationship With Both Parents</strong></h3><p>Katie Manzella’s father, Ray Manzella was not the best of fathers but no one would accuse him of not loving his children. As previously mentioned, we cannot attest to the kind of relationship her brother currently has with their father but some of Katie’s Instagram posts suggest that despite the fractious early years of her existence, they have both found a way to mend the fences that kept them apart for so long.</p><p>Entering into your adolescence with a single parent being primarily responsible for your care and upbringing can be challenging. Certain kids who grow up in that environment tend to act out, and Katie Manzella was one of those kids.</p><p>In her case, the parent who was tasked with her primary care was her mother, Sondra. The former Playmate would be the first to tell you that Katie was a handful in her teenage years. However, the Playboy model was determined not to let her daughter battle the demons of her teenage years alone.</p><p>Practically everyone who knows all about Katie Manzella today would find it hard to associate her with a troubled teenager. The reality, however, remains that she was all that and then some. It is therefore a testament to Sondra’s parenting skills that she turned out the way she did.</p><p>Mother and daughter are very close to each other and regularly take the time to show the world just how close they are with the cosy pictures and other memorabilia which they post on their respective Instagram pages.</p><h3><strong>Katie Manzella Began Her Professional Career As An Actress</strong></h3><p>Even worse than her brother, whose college educational background is known, Katie Manzella’s academic background has been left open to the public and media’s interpretation. One would assume though, judging from the fact that her older brother has a college degree, that she at least found a way to earn a college degree.</p><p>When it came down to choosing a career for herself, Katie initially wanted to pursue a career as an actress, along the same lines as her mother. It didn’t quite pay off as she reportedly ended up appearing in a couple of productions including the adult series The Naughty Show (2011) and Rain Makes Me Wet (2012).</p><p>When it became clear to Katie that she may not achieve her dreams as an actress, she quickly made a switch to a career entirely unrelated to show business. Her Instagram bio at present describes her as a Certified Crystal Healer, Reiki Master & Angel Card Reader, and Theta Healer.</p><p>Her present career is focused on addressing the spiritual well-being of her clients. It remains to be seen how successful she has been in her endeavor.</p><h3><strong>Katie Manzella Is Not Married</strong></h3><p>It’s not much of a surprise that since she ended her career on the silver screens, Katie Manzella has found a way to shield certain details of her private life away from the media and the general public.</p><p>From a thorough perusal of her social media pages, such as Instagram, we can confirm that Katie Manzella is not married and does not have any children. She also appears not to be romantically involved at the moment but she does not, however, spend her days alone.</p><p>Her Instagram pages show that she has a space sister named Aries and a feline pet named Feather.</p><h2><strong>Sondra Theodore’s Children Have Helped Her Overcome Emotional Travails</strong></h2><p>Sondra Theodore’s dating history includes a 5-year relationship, from 1976 to 1981, with the late Playboy magazine founder and editor-in-chief, Hugh Hefner. Suffice it to say those five years were not the best five years Sondra had ever spent.</p><p>While detailing the events that occurred while she was dating the late magazine publisher, the model revealed that she had been emotionally and psychologically abused, even though she didn’t know it at the time.</p><p>Her relationship with Hefner left her with some deep traumatic and psychological scars that took her years of therapy and the support of her children to get over. She especially gushed about the aforementioned support of her children who encouraged her to move on from the horrors of her past. Thankfully she took their advice and is currently living her best life at the moment.</p><p>With the role they played in her emotional and psychological rehabilitation, no one would begrudge the model her pride and love for her two loving children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMCwusOrmGasmJq8pbvRnmSiq12Weq6706Gcq2Wfm3pzecuorZ6kqWKwqbXLnamepl2isqbAjK2fnqVf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./atsushi-sakurai.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Atsushi Sakurai</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keisha-epps-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keisha Epps Net Worth | Bio, Family, Address, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
