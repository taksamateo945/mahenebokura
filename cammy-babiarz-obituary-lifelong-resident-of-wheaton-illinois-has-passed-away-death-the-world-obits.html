Her influence went far beyond the realm of philanthropy. As a daughter, Cammy was caring and considerate, and she was also a loyal friend. Her contagious joy and sincere care for others created bonds that lasted beyond physical distance.</p><p>Cammy was an exemplary worker and an honest role model in her working life. Her lifelong goal of helping the poor and oppressed found an outlet in social work. She committed herself to speaking up for the voiceless in an effort to build a more just and caring society. In spite of all her success, Cammy’s life was truly blessed by the time she got to spend with her loved ones. Those lucky enough to have known her were blessed with an atmosphere of love and support because of her kindness and sincere concern for others.</p><p>Even though Wheaton is sad over losing Cammy Babiarz, she will always be remembered as a compassionate and selfless person. A life lived with compassion and unwavering dedication to helping others can change the world, and her legacy is a testament to that.
