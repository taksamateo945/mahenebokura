The expectation is the women's tournament would follow suit if the men's tournament expands.</p><p>One model featured four additional teams, expanding the current 68-team field to 72. The other featured eight additional teams, which would mean 76 teams in the field.</p><p>Dellenger noted there will not be any expansion until the 2025-26 season at the very earliest.</p><p>As Dellenger explained, there is a tricky balancing act when it comes to any expansion discussions.</p><p>On the one hand, power conferences that will receive the majority of the approximately $700 million the NCAA annually distributes to its schools want more at-large bids available to give more teams the opportunity to both pursue a championship and make additional revenue.</p><p>Additional revenue is particularly notable in today's college sports environment following the the House v. NCAA case that paves the way for eventual revenue sharing with athletes.</p><p>On the other hand, the Big Dance is largely defined by small-conference schools that automatically qualify by winning their league's tournaments then pulling off monumental upsets and capturing the hearts of sports fans across the country.</p><p>In order to avoid eliminating any of the 28 small-conference automatic qualifiers, NCAA leaders would expand the field to include at least one more First Four site with play-in games. That means more teams in the 10-12 seed range playing just one or two days before the traditional opening round with a 64-team bracket.</p><p>And it will also mean discussions about potentially relegating small-conference automatic qualifiers to said play-in tournament games, which they would surely be against in any discussions.</p><p>The most recent expansion moved the tournament from 64 teams to 68 teams in 2011, which led to the First Four that is traditionally held in Dayton, Ohio.</p><p>The First Four sees two pairs of 16 seeds face each other and two pairs of at-large selections face each other for coveted spots in the 64-team bracket that is so synonymous with March Madness. The women's tournament eventually followed suit with an expansion to 68, although it didn't happen until 2022.</p><p>At this point, expansion feels inevitable.</p><p>However, there is still plenty the NCAA officials and conference commissioners will have to work through in order to make it a reality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqBc3yMq5ypp6Kpeq%2BvwJpkrqammratv4ymnKerXaKus6%2FHZqSanJ6awLR5xLGnmqajnryvec%2BlmKerXay2tbSMmpudoaSevK%2Bty2ZrZnBdqbKiudI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-lanter-marries-angela-stacy-2013146.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Lanter Marries Angela Stacy!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lynyrd-skynyrd-drummer-robert-lewis-burns-jr-dies-in-car-crash-at-64-201544.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lynyrd Skynyrd Drummer Robert Lewis Burns Jr. Dies in Car Crash at 64</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
