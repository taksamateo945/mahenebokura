suffered with jealousy and control issues and experienced “episodes” in which he would hear voices and not be able to sleep, Petito’s friend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>Rose Davis, 21, of Sarasota, described Laundrie as a controlling and manipulative boyfriend, in one incident stealing Petitio’s ID so she wouldn’t be able to go out to bars with her.</p><p>Petito had described the strange episodes to Davis, which at times forced Petito to sleep at her house.</p><p>“He’s got these jealousy issues and he struggles from what Gabby called these “episodes,” where he would hear things and hear voices and wouldn’t sleep,” she told the outlet.</p><p>“Gabby had to stay at my house a bunch of times because she just needed a breather and didn’t want to go home to him.”</p><p>Davis said she “used to consider [Laundrie] a friend,” after spending time with the couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gabby-petitos-friend-speaks-305.jpg><p>She said she believes she was one of Petito’s only friends that she had in Florida after relocating there from Long Island, and believed Laundrie was jealous of their relationship and taking her away from him.</p><p>She said the two friends would share locations on their iPhones to keep each other safe “in case we got lost,” but Laundrie made Petito stop sharing once he found out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gabby-petitos-friend-speaks-300.jpg><p>“He had this composure as a sweet, nice, caring guy. But you could tell he’s a little off, a little weird. Like, he’d set up our hammocks when we’d go to the beach, but wouldn’t sit with us, which I found bizarre,” she told the Daily Mail.</p><p>“Brian has a jealousy issue,” Rose said. “I’m her only friend in Florida to my knowledge and that’s not because she can’t make friends, he just didn’t want her to have friends.”</p><p>“He was always worried she was going to leave him,” she said. “It was a constant thing to try to get us to stop hanging out.”</p><p>Davis told the Daily Mail that she’d last spoken to Petito in early August, where they <a href=#>discussed meeting up in Yellowstone National Park</a> in Wyoming for Davis’ birthday on Aug. 29. Davis said that she had requested off work for the days, but never went after never hearing back from Petito.</p><p>She said that the couple never fought in front of her, however she believed that she could tell when they had just had an argument. She said that within the first year of knowing her, Petito spent between seven and 10 nights at her house after they had fought.</p><p>“I do believe that their relationship as they kept going on was getting more problematic. It just seemed like there was more and more arguments,” she told the Daily Mail, adding that they had still planned on getting married despite Petito telling her mother it was called off.</p><p>“Everything she did, I feel like he thought was wrong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gabby-petitos-friend-speaks-304.jpg><p><a href=#>Bodycam footage of the couple fighting</a> in Utah shows Petito inconsolably crying next to Laundrie.</p><p>“For her anxiety to act up like that, there has to be a decent thing to trigger it,” Davis said, adding that she was aware Petito suffered from anxiety. She said she wished that Petito had decided to call her after that incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gabby-petitos-friend-speaks-302.jpg><p>“I’m a little upset she didn’t just call me after that fight, because she would have before,” Davis said.</p><p>Petito has not been seen since Aug. 30, when she was traversing the country with Laundrie.</p><p>Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11 after going more than a week without contacting her family.</p><p>Laundrie returned alone in her van to the Florida home they shared on Sept. 1 and is now missing.</p><p>Davis said she spoke with North Port Police on Tuesday to give them all of the information she said. She’s considered reaching out to Laundrie.</p><p>“I wanted to stand outside his house and to just beg him to tell me where he last saw her, but I know he won’t and I can’t force him to talk to me,” she told the Mail while crying.</p><p>“For all we know, he’s scared and handling this all wrong. I just wish he would talk. Just give me three words, the name of a park. Give me something, something.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqe2orqMpZiuppSntqZ51pqqZpufo8Gzu8uloKefXajCp7LEq5ydZZWltrS7w56qZp%2BRl6%2B6ec%2Beq6Ksn6h6p77InqWdZaOWxrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-horton-phone-number.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Horton Phone Number, WhatsApp Number Contact Number Mobile</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexander-skarsgard-and-katie-holmes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexander Skarsgard and Katie Holmes Are Getting Real Close</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
