He's been a rock for this team since it drafted him in 2020, a year that he helped anchor a Super Bowl-winning offensive line.</p><p>Wirfs made the Pro Bowl in each of the last three seasons and has proved he can adequately protect a quarterback's blind side. He should become one of the NFL's highest-paid offensive linemen in the near future.</p><p><b>Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings</b></p><p>Justin Jefferson has been a force since the Vikings landed him in the 2020 draft. He established himself as the NFL's best receiver in 2022, a year in which he came up just short of breaking Calvin Johnson's all-time single-season yardage record.</p><p>Although Jefferson's star slightly faded during an injury-plagued 2023 campaign, he still breeched the 1,000-yard mark despite missing seven games. There's no question that the Vikings will do everything in their power to keep him around, even if it takes shattering the record <a href=# rel=noopener>$30 million annual salary</a> of Miami Dolphins wideout Tyreek Hill.</p><p><b>Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR, Detroit Lions</b></p><p>There may be no better-value pick in the 2021 draft than St. Brown, whom the Lions were fortunate to land early on Day 3 that year. He's taken the league by storm since then, amassing 3,588 yards and 21 touchdowns on 315 catches while helping to turn Detroit into a legitimate Super Bowl contender.</p><p>The Lions won't have the luxury of picking up a fifth-year option on St. Brown's rookie contract, making it imperative for the front office to hammer out an extension as soon as possible. While he may not break Hill's annual-salary record, St. Brown could easily earn as much as $28 million per year on his next deal.</p><p><b>CeeDee Lamb, WR, Dallas Cowboys</b></p><p>Lamb has been one of the NFL's top pass-catchers since the Cowboys selected him with the No. 17 pick in the 2020 draft, but he took another major leap last year. The star wideout posted career highs in catches (135), receiving yardage (1,749) and touchdowns (12) while serving as the top playmaker in Dallas' high-powered offense.</p><p>There's little chance that the Cowboys will even consider letting the 24-year-old reach the open market after such a special start to his career. Don't be surprised if the club makes a Lamb extension its top priority this offseason.</p><p><b>Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins</b></p><p>After waffling about Tagovailoa's ability to become their franchise signal-caller, the Dolphins finally put an end to the trade rumors and made it clear they were committing to him ahead of the 2022 season. They brought in Hill that offseason, and Tagovailoa has flourished since.</p><p>It's now time for Miami to lock the 26-year-old up for the foreseeable future. There's almost zero chance he'll be allowed to test the market after amassing 8,172 passing yards and 54 touchdowns in his last 30 starts.</p><p>Considering he's also taken the 'Phins to back-to-back playoff appearances following a half-decade postseason hiatus, Tagovailoa is poised to become one of the league's highest-paid players.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmBdYGMqamenJmYwaq6xmauoaGTnXqvsstmp6WZqZq%2FtHnCqKylnF2nsrSx02aroZ1dm7%2BmsYyanp6mpGK6or7KnqtmoZ5if3F%2BlGamn56jmq60u80%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1505709-power-ranking-the-greatest-49ers-teams-in-nfl-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Power Ranking the Greatest 49ers Teams in NFL History | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./730115-wwe-men-in-the-shadow-the-10-most-notorious-referees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WWE Men in the Shadows: The 10 Most Notorious Referees | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harold-ford-jr-mother-the-woman-behind-the-politician.html>Harold Ford Jr. Mother: The Woman Behind the Politician</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leonardo-barbadoro-unveils-bomi-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-music.html>Leonardo Barbadoro Unveils 'Bomi' A Glimpse into the Future of Music</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./157099-larsa-pippens-net-worth-age-children-spouse-career-what.html>Larsa Pippen's net worth, age, children, spouse, career, what is she known for?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./deceitful-and-crafty-html.html>Deceitful and crafty</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./death-of-dina-bourque.html>Death of Dina Bourque: The principal of Iberia Middle School was identified as the victim of the fat</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog.
