We’ll answer this question and reveal a lot more about the rapper in this post. So, stay tuned!</p><p><strong>According to </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>sources</strong></a><strong>, Aubrey Drake Graham better known as Drake is a vegan at present. The actor, singer cum rapper was not a vegan from birth but he ditched meat at the age of 31. At the beginning of 2018, the superstar made a switch to the vegan life. He even confirmed so during a </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>gaming session in Twitch</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>How was Drake’s life before the switch? How is he now? What to learn the entire story? Are you eager to find out who/what inspired Drake to shift towards a vegetarian diet? Then read on!</p><p>Without further ado, let’s get the ball rolling:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did Drake Become a Vegan?</h2><p>Drake was not a vegetarian during his childhood. He was for certain a non-vegetarian. He ate everything from eggs, chicken to fish. However, he said goodbye to beef and chose to advance towards an all-vegan life at the age of 31. The superstar is a vegan so much so that he even uses toothpaste containing activated charcoal to brush his teeth.</p><p>On 10th March 2018, an Instagram post of the Canadian superstar hinted that he has gone vegan. He posted an image where he’s seen in an angry expression. He was looking towards another guy in the image, who too seemed infuriated. It was the caption of this image that indicated his vegan status.&nbsp;</p><p>The caption read, “If two vegans are angry at each other…is it beef?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>After this post, the rumors of him being a vegan spread like jungle fire. On the contrary, a majority of Media regarded it as a ‘corny post’ by the rapper. The superstar finally put an end to the speculations and confirmed the news after some days on <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitch</a>.</p><p>As we know that the Canadian rapper is an avid gamer. He joined the gaming platform, Twitch with the popular blue-haired gamer Ninja to play Fortnite on 15th April 2018. When they were waiting in the game’s lobby for other participants, the guys got involved in a casual discussion. While discussing pizza, Drake left a remark which clearly indicated his vegan status.&nbsp;</p><p>The superstar said, “I feel like chicken and pineapple on pizza could work, but I don’t eat meat anymore”. This statement finally confirmed that Drake is a vegan.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Inspired Drake to Adopt a Vegetarian Diet?</h2><p>Drake announced that he has gone vegan in the mid of March in 2018. Few weeks before the announcement, Drake’s fellow musician and good friend Beyonce announced that she’d follow a 44-days plant-based diet to get in shape to deliver a Coachella<a href=# rel=noopener> performance</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The musician announced this via her Instagram account and she even urged her Instagram followers and friends to join her. Hence, the speculations were rife that Drake took the step after getting inspired by Beyonce, as he was her huge follower.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo of Beyonce and Drake is a deadly combo. Together they have given record-breaking track like “Mine”. In addition to their great music chemistry, Drake is a huge fan of Queen Bey. In fact, there’s a six-foot-tall portrait of Beyonce in Drake’s studio. Furthermore, he even dedicated a song to the singer titled ‘Girls Love Beyonce’.&nbsp;</p><p>When he is such a huge fan, why won’t he get influenced by the superstar and listen to her call? Hence, there was a buzz that Beyonce was the reason behind Drake’s switch to a vegan diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Drake Grow Up As A Vegan?</h2><p>No, Drake was raised in a family that ate meat. Hence, Drake used to eat a lot of meat and even his diet included non-veg items. His favorite delicacy also <a href=# rel=noopener>reveals his love for non-veg</a> food items. According to reports, the Canadian superstar loved White Wine Spritzers until he announced the news of himself going vegan. This low-calorie beverage has wine in it and it includes non-plant ingredients such as isinglass, egg-white and pectin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to White Wine Spritzers, the rapper has love towards ‘The Cheesecake Factory’, which is clearly denoted in the lyrics of his single Child’s Play. The lyric says “Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake? You know I love to go there”.&nbsp;</p><p>It is indeed true that the star loves Cheesecake even today. However, it doesn’t indicate whether he eats non-veg cheesecake as there are vegan options in the market. Furthermore, there are vegan options for wine as well.&nbsp;</p><p>His love for non-veg food items and dishes was also indicated in another track named ‘4 pm in Calabasas’. In this song, the rapper mentions eating calamari during summers, which is again a non-veg dish. However, this track belonged to the year 2016 and in 2018 the rapper let go off his love for all animal-based products when he chose to become a vegan.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did People React to Drake’s Vegan Shift?</h2><p>When the world came to know Drake is a vegan, everyone seemed excited.&nbsp;</p><p>PETA was super excited after hearing the star’s confession. To express their happiness, they sent a vegan gift basket to the rapper with passion fruit in it. Since Drake is a role model for millions of fans, PETA believed that the move was a great one as that would influence others in quitting the animal-based diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as expected by PETA, many fans spoke up on the social platform regarding their decision to follow the footsteps of their idol in the quitting spree.</p><p>Have a look at some of the reactions:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Drake is vegan I’m vegan. Seriously that’s all it takes. Veganism starting today. Meat is wack now smh.</p>— ?

They requested Drake to adopt veganism and stop wearing the fur coats as these were made of coyote’s fur.&nbsp;</p><p>Even his home town, Toronto celebrated this vegan switch. A Toronto based brand, Freshii began a Billboard campaign for the superstar. They entitled him as ‘Kale God’ and even featured Drake’s praying hands in the Billboard advertisement.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Furthermore, the brand launched a microsite kalegod.com, just to thank him for the move. There was a thank you letter on the website along with information that explained the benefits of plant-based diet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final words</h2><p>Now that you know your favorite star Drake is a vegan, do you intend to follow his footsteps?
